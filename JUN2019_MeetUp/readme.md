Logging in Python

# <font color=#2b8cbe>Purpose</font>
The talk is a walk through of Python's Logging module and an 
introduction to some of the module's most useful features. In addition to highlighting useful features it will touch on when and why you may want to use Logging and how to use it. 

The hope is that someone using Python for a project in their agency or organization can use the simple implementation examples provided to understand where they could implement something similar or improve how they communicate with technical or non techncial staff within or supporting their agencies.
