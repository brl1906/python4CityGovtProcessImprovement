This month Christine Zhang from The Baltimore Sun joins us to talk about data analysis workflows using both Python and R! She'll talk through an article/project she worked on where she needed to use both Python and R to help parse and understand the data.

Christine is a Data Journalist with The Baltimore Sun where she reports news stories using data analysis and statistics (using mostly R and Python). Before joining The Sun in 2018, she worked as a data scientist at Two Sigma and was previously an OpenNews fellow at the Los Angeles Times and a research analyst at the Brookings Institution. She has a B.A. from Smith College and an M.A. from Columbia University.
