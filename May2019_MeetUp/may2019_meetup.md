This month we'll talk through a project from the Department of General Services where we used Python to help map citywide gas and electric billing to distinct buildings so that we can track billing for budget projections, monitor energy usage, and build a better understanding for how we can build more sustainable energy systems for the city.

As a reminder, we switched locations to Spark Baltimore (8 Market Pl #300, Baltimore, MD 21202). Check with the front desk, and they'll show you to our meeting room!
